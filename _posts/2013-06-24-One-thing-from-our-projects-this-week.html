Note: most of us are on different projects<br /><br />Having the proper number of environments is crucial to truly complete what you have deemed the "definition of done". (<i>Apryl</i>)<br /><br />We just started an architectural change which will take us from Enterprise Java Beans to Spring beans... translating beans is astonishingly tedious. (<i>Linda</i>)<br /><br />Take the time to find out how much effort it would take to make something better since the investment you could put in might save you much pain down the road. (<i>Sarah</i>)<br /><br />We're able to track who is working on what story with avatars of ourselves stuck on our chosen story card, and we're making sure we're pairing evenly with a well displayed chart. (<i>Aubrey</i>)<br /><br />I am currently working on identifying flows for the UI tests for the first time; this has been a project since the UI tests so far have acted more like unit tests and therefore have been multiplying and their cost/value ratio is suffering.
