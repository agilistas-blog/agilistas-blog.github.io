I learned that a library called UTFgrid exists, which is designed to load map data on mobile connections and/or legacy browsers by displaying the map tiles as ASCII art! (<i>Linda</i>)<br /><br />Apart from learning that I'm not built for living at high altitude, I saw in action the importance of networking; TW is a wealth of knowledge and opportunity when it comes to picking the brains of all the talent in the company. (<i>Chisara</i>)<br /><br />Sometimes you have to make a choice between two opportunities; one may come once in a lifetime... others come more often; pick one, be happy with the decision, and don't look back; that decision may change your life! (<i>Apryl</i>)<br /><br />A title can tell you little more than what the presenter believes they are saying. (<i>Sarah</i>)<br /><br />I learned that code bases won't necessarily have passing tests right out of the box on IntelliJ, even when the build passes on the command line. (<i>Crystal, at TWU</i>)<br /><br />I learned that Postgres allows users to have roles, giving greater flexibility when changing permissions. (<i>Aubrey, at TWU</i>)<br /><br />
