The topic is just a starting point: feel free to not address the whole topic, or write about something not fully on-topic.

Donâ€™t use any company (client) or individual names

Length: aim for longer than a sentence and shorter than a thesis :) (10 - 500 words, ish)

Put your name (first or first and last) on your response
