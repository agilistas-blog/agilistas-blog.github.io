What: Group blogging from the women-in-tech-perspective

Who: Women in tech and their allies in all roles (not just developers!) New contributors *always* welcome :)

Where: Via pull request at [https://github.com/agilistas-blog/agilistas-blog.github.io](https://github.com/agilistas-blog/agilistas-blog.github.io) (or email them to me and I can make the pull request for you, or walk you through learning to create one)

Why: To practice writing, to express ourselves, to hear about the cool ideas of others! More reasons: [http://agilistaconfessions.blogspot.com/2013/08/benefits-of-group-blogging.html](http://agilistaconfessions.blogspot.com/2013/08/benefits-of-group-blogging.html)

How: With your input!

History: previously at [http://agilistaconfessions.blogspot.com/](http://agilistaconfessions.blogspot.com/) (I migrated the old posts over)


### Some questions:

- Should we use a different name than "agilistas"?
- How often should posts go out? (I'm planning to start with every two weeks)
- What, specifically, are the goals of this?
- What are some topic ideas?
