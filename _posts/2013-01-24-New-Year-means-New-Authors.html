<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b>Kate Moczydlowski</b><br />I’ve been a Consultant with development tendencies at Thoughtworks since September 2011.&nbsp; I’ve never been one to say no to learning or trying something new.&nbsp; I have an eclectic range of interests ranging from: writing poetry, to dancing,&nbsp; to classical literature, to cooking, to the dissection of movie plots, and most likely anything remotely technology related. I’ve been developing for as long as I have had an internet connection, because who didn’t make a geocities page back then? I work hard and take great pride in everything that I do. That’s a nice way of saying I can be a little bit of a workaholic. Trying to find that balance is something I find myself really trying to achieve and am ever curious how others do.<br /><br />Now I am not a person who likes to define herself too much. I like being abstract and open to change. The few traits that I choose, or at least hope, to define me are my kind heart, an open mind, and a childlike curiosity(mentioned above).&nbsp; I have a passion for making the world a better place everyday, even if it is just by giving a stranger a smile.&nbsp; I think there is something so powerful in something so simple as a smile or a laugh.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am excited for what the future will bring, through the challenges and triumphs the experience is what makes us who we are.&nbsp; I can only hope to experiences ahead help me move the mountains I want to move and create a ripple in time.<br /><br /><b>Abby Bangser</b><br />I joined ThoughtWorks in March of 2012 as a Quality Analyst. In college, I majored in political science and worked in real estate investments for over 3 years. My investment job showed me how much more productive a person or company can be when utilizing technology properly. Soon web scraping and excel macros were just not enough to maintain my interest, so I looked to move into even more code. Software development is a field that I can see staying in for a long time, since it will not only continue to challenge and excite me but also provide me with a chance to do great things in the world, especially through ThoughtWorks' social impact work.<br /><br />In my free time, I am an avid traveler. After college, I got my Dive Master certification in scuba diving, which has provided an amazing added perspective to my trips. At home, I love coaching as well as playing as many rec sports as possible. Have to say, dodgeball and kickball are arguably be the best out there!<br /><br /><br /><b>Apryl Gordy</b><br />My name is Apryl Gordy and I joined ThoughtWorks June of 2012. Before that I was hard at work at IUPUI (Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis) majoring in Mechanical Engineering Technology. While attending classes I was active on campus with many different student organizations that focused on changing the world we live in while accepting the differences amongst us. My love for dissecting technology and piecing it back together, along with my hope for a better social and economical just place of living, all lead me to accept a position at ThouhgtWorks as a Developer. The promise of continuous learning, improving, evolvement and challenge keep me here..along with the beautiful smiling faces you see everyday.<br /><br />In my spare time, I enjoy traveling. I’ve had the pleasure of visiting 38 of the 50 states, and 7 different countries within 3 different continents. I love music and have been able to call myself a drummer since the 5th grade. In addition to that I am a lover of electronics, cars and sports. So if there is either a carshow, NBA or NFL game, drumline or electronic store in the vicinity, you better believe I’m front row center drooling over the magnificence.<br /><br /><b>Sarah Hutchins</b><br />I joined ThoughtWorks August of 2011 as a developer coming from a computer engineering background. Whilst in college I pursued a variety of interests, always trying something new. This combined with my hope for humanity caused me to pursue a career at ThoughtWorks. I enjoy the traveling and the challenges presented by the variety of projects ThoughtWorks takes up.<br /><br />Outside of traveling, I enjoy spending my time doing outdoor pursuits such as biking and hiking. I also usually have a couple instruments on me which I am in the process of trying to learn in my spare time. </div>
